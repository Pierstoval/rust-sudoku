# Rust Sudoku

A simple sudoku project, used as a way to learn Rust.

The puzzle generation algorithm is pretty simple and the highlighting mechanism is opinionated by design (does full highlighting always).

Works pretty well in browser and on phones.

I'm probably not going to update this project much more.
